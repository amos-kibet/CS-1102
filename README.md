# CS-1102
## A simple quiz code snippet that asks the user to answer a multiple choice question
## The program checks if the user chose an asnwer from the available choices and throws an error if not
## The correct answer is hardcoded in the program and the program checks the user's answer against the preprogrammed answer
## If it is correct, it shows a "Correct" dialog, and exits upon clicking okay
## If not correct, it shows "Incorrect..." for any answer in the choices provided or "Invalid..." for a different answer and asks the question again.
